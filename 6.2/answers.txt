6.2 Describe C programming concepts in regard to memory


Objectives

- [ ] Dynamically allocated memory
- [ ] Statically allocated memory
- [ ] In the context of automatic vs dynamic allocation, explain how those concepts are related to the implementation of a stack and heap in a C program
- [ ] Memory map of a Linux process
- [ ] Automatically allocated memory


-Dynamically allocated memory
Memory that is allocated at runtime, generally using malloc or calloc.

-Statically allocated memory
Memory that is allocated at compile time. For declared variables/data structures.

-In the context of automatic vs dynamic allocation, explain how those concepts are related to the implementation of a stack and heap in a C program
Automatic or static allocated memory is placed in the stack. Dynamically allocated memory is placed in the heap. Memory on the heap needs to be freed
to reuse that memory space whereas on the stack the memory is 'freed' automatically as variables and functions go out of scope or return.

-Automatically allocated memory
Memory allocation that occurs on the stack automatically when a variable is declared.

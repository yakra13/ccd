# Mentor/Apprentice Relationship Working Agreement


## Purpose
This Apprenticeship Agreement will govern our values, expectations, and processes.

This agreement will help us:
    • Establish communication expectations
    • Identify goals for the apprenticeship
    • Outline skill areas to be enhanced or developed

### As a apprentice, I agree to do the following:
    1. I take full responsibility for my training.  No one else is responsible for my success or failure.  
    2. If I need help I will seek it out from others including (but not limited to) my mentor.
    3. I will be proactive and take initiative to find multiple opportunities and experiences to enhance my learning.
    4. I will meet regularly with my mentor and maintain frequent communication.
    5. Review my progress and adjust my contract as I work towards my identified goals.

### As a mentor, I agree to do the following:
    1. Serve as a mentor and provide guidance, oversight, and encouragement.
    2. Provide feedback on your work in an open and honest fashion.
    3. Meet in person or communicate regularly with my apprentice to review your progress and help you work toward your goals.

## Arbitration
This agreement outlines the goals and expectations agreed upon by the mentor and apprentice. While we have done our best to thoughtfully get it right, we believe we should revisit this document every __6__ months to adjust. If at any time during the apprenticeship either of us feels the other is unable or unwilling to fulfill the items agreed to above, we will be honest with each other to hopefully resolve the problem.  If this does not work, we recognize that either of us may approach our supervisor(s) to assist us further.  

## Expectations
Both mentor and apprentice should have clear expectations for what they expect to gain from the relationship, these objectives will form the nature of the relationship and help ensure that it progresses to the satisfaction of both parties.

### Goals and Objectives
In addition to the overall goals listed below the mentor will help the apprentice set objectives that align their goals to CYT's action items.

#### Mentorship Style
> Select the appropriate mentorship style and delete the others.

*Empowerment: The mentee is needing help being empowered to solve workplace problems OR the mentor is holding the reins too tightly and wants a controlled path to passing responsibility to the mentee; http://www.davidhuntoon.com/leaders/successful-leaders-use-empowerment-build-trust-excellence/*
The primary focus will be on how the mentee can help change occur in the workplace. The first step will be the mentor and mentee working to identify what areas need to be passed to the mentee, and what level of oversight the mentor needs to maintain, it may be helpful to involve the mentor's supervisor/team leader during this phase. The mentor will then ensure that responsibility is passed to the mentee in a controlled fashion.

**Difference between conducting C-ISR and C-SR**
> C-ISR is typically employed to support strategic and tactical objectives, providing a comprehensive understanding of the cyber threat landscape, enhancing situational awareness, and informing defensive and offensive cyber operations. Whereas C-SR is more operational and tactical in nature, providing real-time or near-real-time data to support immediate decision-making and response efforts. It is often employed to support incident response, threat hunting, and operational planning by identifying and characterizing potential threats and vulnerabilities.

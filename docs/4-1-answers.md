Phase I is the Engagement, Prioritization and Tasking phase where community engagement with mission partners identifies a potential need. 

Phase II is the Agile Scrum Development phase which begins when the DevCrew begins working on a new product from the squadron product backlog. The PO is responsible for Phase II and Phase III of the product.

### Answers

**Remote Operator (ION, RO)**
> Conducts access collection, processing, and/or geolocation of wired or wireless computer and digital networks in order to exploit, locate, and/or track targets of interest.

**Mission Commander (MC)**
> leads and coordinates cyber attack missions against adversary targets. Responsible for mission planning, execution, and overall strategic oversight, ensuring that operations align with broader objectives. Integrates intelligence, technical capabilities, and operational resources to effectively direct cyber forces, manage risks, and achieve mission success while adhering to legal and policy constraints.

**Exploitation Analyst (EA)**
> Collaborates to identify access and collection gaps that can be satisfied through cyber collection and/or preparation activities. Leverages all authorized resources and analytic techniques to penetrate targeted networks.

**Digital Network Exploitation Analyst (DNEA) and Target Digital Networking Analyst (TDNA)**
> DNEA conducts C-ISR to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in target networks by gathering intelligence, monitoring network activities, and performing reconnaissance to support cyber attack planning and execution.
> TDNA focuses on identifying and analyzing key targets within adversary networks by mapping digital infrastructures, pinpointing critical nodes, and assessing the strategic value of potential targets. Provide insights that guide the planning and execution of cyber attacks.

**Operational Target Development Analyst (OTDA), Targeteer, and Fire Support Planner**
> OTDA identifies and validates potential targets by analyzing intelligence and technical data, ensuring they meet operational requirements and strategic objectives.
> Targeteer assesses and prioritizes targets based on their value, feasibility, and potential impact. Provide detailed target information and recommendations for mission planning.
> Fire Support Planner integrates cyber operations into broader tactical and strategic plans, coordinating with other military assets to ensure synchronized and effective use of cyber capabilities in achieving mission objectives.

**Cyber Operations Planner**
> Develops detailed plans for the conduct or support of the applicable range of cyber operations through collaboration with other planners, operators and/or analysts. Participates in targeting selection, validation, synchronization, and enables integration during the execution of cyber actions.

**Team Lead and Deputy Team Lead**
> Team Leads provide overall leadership and direction for the team, ensuring the successful planning, coordination, and execution of cyber operations. They are accountable for mission outcomes, resource allocation, and maintaining operational readiness while ensuring compliance with legal and policy guidelines.
> Deputy Team Leads support the Team Lead by assisting in the management and coordination of daily operations, stepping in as acting lead when necessary.

**Language Analyst (LA)**
> Applies language and culture expertise with target/threat and technical knowledge to process, analyze, and/or disseminate intelligence information derived from language, voice and/or graphic material. Creates, and maintains language specific databases and working aids to support cyber action execution and ensure critical knowledge sharing. Provides subject matter expertise in foreign language-intensive or interdisciplinary projects.

**Target Analyst Reporter (TAR)**
> Provides synthesized product to customers by researching, analyzing, and reporting  intelligence via appropriate reporting vehicles, in response to IC requirements and IAW missions of SIGINT, cybersecurity, and cyberspace operations. Prioritizes, assesses, evaluates, and reports information obtained from passive and active collection, network evaluation and analysi. Maintains awareness of internal and external customer requirements. Shares target-related information, and provides feedback as appropriate. Helps develop databases or working aids on target activity to enhance and build target knowledge and improve collection to execute missions.

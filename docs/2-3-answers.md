- [ ] Combatant Command CPT
- [ ] Service CPT


### Answers

**National CPT**
> National CPTs operate both on-DODIN and off-DODIN (blue cyberspaces) to defend CI/KR in support of CCMD and U.S. Government priorities. They protect DOD strategic assets and MRT-C by reinforcing organic network defenders during cyber-threat events, and secure cyberspace assets as directed in support of coalition and strategic mission partners. May perform Hunt Forward Operations as required as well as augment DODIN, CCMD, and Service CPTs.

**DoDIN CPT**
> Address DOD enterprise-wide priorities, and operate primarily across the Defense Information Systems Network. As required, these CPTs operate globally across the DODIN to protect high-priority mission requirements, or in response to assets extending across otherwise unprotected organizational boundaries or enterprise systems. 

**Combatant Command CPT**
> Operate primarily across CCMD-controlled portions of the DODIN and coordinate across the DODIN to protect CCMD missions or CCMD regional assets and MRT-C. May operate in coalition and mission partner networks, as requested by the supported CCMD.  

**Service CPT**
> Operate primarily within Service-controlled segments of the DODIN and are generally bounded by the Service network boundaries. Operations may include protection of Service missions, protection of CO within Service controlled areas of operations, or protection of Service-provisioned networks supporting CCMDs.

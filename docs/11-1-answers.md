# 11.1 Describe terms and concepts associated with secure coding practices

### Objectives

- [ ] Common string-handling functions
- [ ] Which functions guarantee null terminated strings
- [ ] An off-by-one error
- [ ] An integer overflow
- [ ] A buffer overflow
- [ ] The concept of use-after-free
- [ ] Resource acquisition is initialization (RAII)
- [ ] The difference between input validation vs. input sanitization
- [ ] General low-level crypto basics (e.g. different encryption schemes and how you might implement them system wide, what crypto is better for different use cases)
- [ ] Penetration testing principles, tools, and techniques
- [ ] Obfuscation techniques
- [ ] The meaning of a pure function and if a function has a side-effect
